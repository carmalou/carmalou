						<p class="first">About Carmen<br /><br />
						Carmen is a Web Developer in the Oklahoma City area. During her days, she works on JavaScript applications for a local company. Outside of work, she can be found watching Netflix with a computer in her lap trying to make sense of some tricky code snippet.
						<br /><br />
						A friendly, and easily approachable individual, Carmen has a knack for working with people. She's not one to give up on a challenge, having put herself through college working full time. In 2012, Carmen graduated from Oklahoma City University with a Bachelors Degree in Mass Communications. Her first job was at a newspaper, and she loves telling the story of how she moved from newspaper reporter to JavaScript developer. (It's kind of a long story, so be careful with this one.)
						<br /><br />
						Her interests include news and current events, JavaScript, and pancakes. Carmen also enjoys other breakfast foods, and has a love of typewriters.</p>
